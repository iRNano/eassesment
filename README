# Eassessment

The Eassessment contains the Card component, which is a reusable React component used within the application to display user information.

## Features

- Fetches user data from an API endpoint.
- Renders user name and email address in a card format.
- Provides a refresh button to fetch new data.
- Responsive design with a mobile breakpoint.

## Usage

Import the Card component and use it within your application components:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Card from "./components/Card";

const UserDetailPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Details</h1>
      <Card />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserDetailPage;
```
````

The Card component can be customized using styled-components and supports responsive design with a mobile breakpoint.
